            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>
                During the Fall Semester of 2021 I completed the Professional and Technical Writing class. The focus of this class was to help students develop their interpersonal and real-world problem solving skills. As well as intruct on how better operate in a mulicultral
                professional environment, by making aware of potential implict bias, and common cultural norms.

            <h2>Syllabus Redesign</h2>
            <p>One of our early assignments were to do what we would think would be a good redesign of the class syllabus, My rendition can be seen below</p>

            <h2>Project Why</h2>
            <p>We also had to submit completed a project that was a short introduction about yourself, and the personal motivations that drive you.</p>
