                    Welcome to my E-Portfolio, a breif description of accomplishments whether large or small from my school, work, and personal life.

                <h2>About me</h2>

                <p>
                    I was born and raised on the Carribean island known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominica" target="blank">Commonwealth of Dominica</a> where I graduated from the Saint Mary's Academy,was part of our nations Cadet Corps
                    and went on many adventures with Friends and Family-alike . Growing up there taught be to appreciate the smaller things in life and to not take those things for granted, because nothing is ever certain. What motivated me from leaving
                    paradise to come to America was ultimately opportunity ,my love for Technology and a uncanny drive to provide for my family.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Currently I am in pursuit of my B.S in Computer Science at the University of West Georgia. Which came with its own challenges that were indeed unexpected, however I'm persevering. One solution I to the challenges were to join the U.S Army, which turned
                    out to be one of the better decisions I've made. It's pushed by Professional life to heights that I would not have acheived myself and gave me life long lessons and Battle Buddies.
