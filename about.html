            <p>Out of all the things I enjoy doing video gaming has to be my all time passion. Although 9/10 of the games I play stress me out, it serves as my main form decompress and cooping after a stressful day. Ontop of this, it often grants me a great
                opportunity to meet new people, as well as hang out with the friends I've made over the years. Some of my favourite games I've play include: Black Desert Online, Dark Souls, Sid Meier's Civilization, Smite, and Doom Eternal</p>
